# Debian Bullseye Deployment

Using both docker and a standard x86_64 full install, the following issues had to be
finessed to get the first example configuration to run with the latest develop branches.

## STapp-0004-Waveform-1.cfg

Hard coded non-standard path of "/localtmp" is a hangover from Docker attempts to keep 
a clear separation of the host and guest filesystems.  Easy solution is mkdir /localtmp
but this then falls in the trap of assuming that the user has root privileges.

Fix : use "/var/tmp" in place of "/localtmp" which works with docker -v/var/tmp:/var/tmp

Learning point : PATH dependent aspects of CFG files are easily made fragile.

## EPICS build

## Startup Noise

The message "LoadableLibrary: Failed dlopen()" for intentionally non-existent shared objects is irritating.
e.g. LinuxTimer.drv searched for, but LinuxTimer.so provided.  The source of this message is 
MARTe2-dev/Source/Core/BareMetal/L1Portability/Environment/Linux/LoadableLibrary.cpp
