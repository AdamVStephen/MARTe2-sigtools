# 0001 Submodules

A MARTe2 based application project, in this case MARTe2-sigtools, shall use git submodules to manage the upstream dependency on MARTe2 and MARTe2-components repositories.

## Forks and Distributions

The working assumption for distributions and forks of the MARTe2 and MARTe2-components projects are as follows :

- Primary reference is ITER/F4E but this favours highest QA and stability.
- Individual organisations that adopt MARTe2 will have public and private forks.  UKAEA is an example.
- Community MARTe distributions may arise that integrate from above and below.
- Fast moving subgroups that are working on cutting edge features/variants will arise spontaneously.
- Individuals may choose to maintain their own forks, with a variety of motivations.

## IP, Licensing, Copyright, QA, Security

For any contributions back to the core projects, they must be compatible with the original EUPL license.

Other workflows and topics are the subject of ongoing study.  Guides and policies will be published in due course.
