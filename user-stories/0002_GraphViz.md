#Graphviz Tool

From the MARTe2-demos-padova/Configurations folder, look for the diagrams and hence the Makefile with the diagram generation recipe.

To do 

1. Make sure the graphviz tools for diagramming are integrated in the MARTe2-sigtools project
2. Add any dependencies for the tools to the docker image.
3. Check that diagrams can easily be generated and viewed.
